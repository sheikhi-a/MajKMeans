Description: A hybrid of the K-means algorithm and a Majorization-Minimization method to introduce a robust clustering. The reference paper is: Julien Mairal, (2015) <doi:10.1137/140957639>. The two most important functions in package 'MajKMeans' are cluster_km() and cluster_MajKm(). cluster_km() clusters data without Majorization-Minimization and cluster_MajKm() clusters data with Majorization-Minimization method. Both of these functions calculate the sum of squares (SS) of clustering.
